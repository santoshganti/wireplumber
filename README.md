# WirePlumber Configuration for SteamOS & Linux Gaming

## üéÆ Purpose of This Repository

This repository provides **WirePlumber configuration files** designed to enhance **audio behavior on SteamOS, Bazzite, and other Linux gaming distros**. The goal is to **fix common audio issues, prevent unwanted device switching, and improve compatibility**‚Äîall without requiring root access. These configurations are **stored in ****`~/.config/wireplumber/`**, ensuring they **persist across OS updates** while remaining easy to modify or remove.

### ‚úÖ What This Repo Fixes / Improves:

- **Prevents PlayStation controllers from hijacking audio output** (e.g., DualSense becoming the default device).
- **Keeps Bluetooth headsets in high-quality A2DP mode** instead of auto-switching to low-quality HFP.
- **Stops HDMI and Bluetooth audio from suspending**, reducing audio delays after idle periods.
- **Improves audio behavior in virtual machines (VMs)** by increasing buffer sizes.
- **Disables ****`libcamera`**** on gaming devices** where it's not needed (e.g., Steam Deck/Bazzite setups).
- **Disables ****`systemd-logind`**** seat monitoring for Bluetooth**, preventing multi-user conflicts that can cause unintended audio device switching. This is especially useful for gaming setups where multiple user sessions or Steam's `gamescope-session` might interfere with Bluetooth audio behavior.

### üÜö What‚Äôs Different From SteamOS / Bazzite?

This project **builds on existing SteamOS & Bazzite configurations** but improves upon them by:

- **Making everything user-configurable** inside `~/.config/wireplumber/` so updates won't wipe changes.
- **Organizing files better** (proper numbering to ensure correct load order).
- **Adding compatibility fixes** from the **Arch Wiki & community findings**.
- **Giving users an easy way to undo changes** if they want to revert.

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Install

1. **Backup your existing WirePlumber configs** (so you can restore later if needed):
   ```bash
   mv ~/.config/wireplumber ~/.config/wireplumber-bak
   ```
2. **Clone this repository and copy the files into your WirePlumber config folder:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/wireplumber-configs.git
   cp -r wireplumber-configs/wireplumber.conf.d ~/.config/wireplumber/
   ```
3. **Restart WirePlumber to apply the changes:**
   ```bash
   systemctl --user restart wireplumber
   ```

## üîÑ How to Undo Changes

If you experience issues or want to **restore your previous settings**:

1. **Remove the custom configurations:**
   ```bash
   rm -rf ~/.config/wireplumber/wireplumber.conf.d
   ```
2. **Restore your original WirePlumber configs (if you made a backup earlier):**
   ```bash
   rm -rf ~/.config/wireplumber && mv ~/.config/wireplumber-bak ~/.config/wireplumber
   ```
3. **Restart WirePlumber:**
   ```bash
   systemctl --user restart wireplumber
   ```
